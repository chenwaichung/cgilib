.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine returns a pointer to the value of a cgi variable.
Encoded characters (%nn) are already decoded.  One must not free the
pointer.

fields are used (i.e. a variable that may contain several values) the
value returned contains all these values concatenated together with a
newline character as separator.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

transmitted through CGI or was empty NULL is returned.
