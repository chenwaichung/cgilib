To use this library simply include the cgi.h include file with the
following command in your C programs:

#include <cgi.h>

And add the libcgi.a to the linker either by modifying the LDFLAGS in
your makefiles or by adding `-lcgi' to the appropriate commandline.


If you have additions, questions or improvements please don't hesitate
to contact me.
