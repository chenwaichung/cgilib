Using this Library
------------------
To use this library you need to include the cgi.h include file with the
following command into your C programs:

   #include <cgi.h>

Additionally you'll have to add the library libcgi.a to the linker,
either by modifying LDFLAGS in your makefiles or by adding `-lcgi' to
the appropriate commandline.

Test Suite
----------

This library comes with a program called cgitest.c.  You can use it as
reference implementation for this CGI library.  Therefore it should be
included as source in your distribution.

If you want to test your forms you can use the following action.

   <form action=/cgi-bin/cgitest/listall method=post>

The /listall target will display all environment variables and all CGI
variables that were transmitted.  This way you can test your
implementations quite easy.
