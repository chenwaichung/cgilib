.SH NAME
cgiGetCookies \- Returns a list of cookies
.SH SYNOPSYS
.nf
.B #include <cgi.h>
.sp
.BI "char **cgiGetCookies (s_cgi *" parms );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine returns a NULL terminated array of cookies that were
transmitted by the client.  To get the value of a cookie you'll have
to use
.BR cgiGetCookie (3).

You have to free the array on your own.  You can use the
following code fragment:
.nf
    char **vars;
    int i;
    s_cgi *cgi;

    cgi = cgiInit();

    vars = cgiGetCookies (cgi);
    if (!vars)
	return;

    for (i=0; vars[i] != NULL; i++)
        free (vars[i]);
	
    free (vars);
.fi

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success a NULL terminated array of strings is returned.  The last
element is set to NULL.  If an error occurred or if no cookies were
available NULL is returned.
