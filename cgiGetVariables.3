.SH NAME
cgiGetVariables \- Returns a list of CGI variables
.SH SYNOPSYS
.nf
.B #include <cgi.h>
.sp
.BI "char **cgiGetVariables (s_cgi **" parms );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine returns a NULL terminated array of CGI variables that are
available.  To get the value of a variable you'll have to use
.BR cgiGetValue (3).

You will have to free the array on your own.  You can use the
following code fragment:
.nf
    char **vars;
    int i;
    s_cgi **cgi;

    cgi = cgiInit();

    vars = cgiGetVariables (cgi);
    if (!vars)
	return;

    for (i=0; vars[i] != NULL; i++)
        free (vars[i]);
	
    free (vars);
.fi

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success a NULL terminated array of strings is returned.  The last
element is set to NULL.  If an error occurred or if no variables were
available NULL is returned.
